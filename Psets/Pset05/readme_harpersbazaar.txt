 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA lab hours,

 I did not receive any help outside of TA lab hours.  I
 did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any

 *  Explain why it makes sense to have a separate RingBuffer class.

/**********************************************************************

  I created a VisualHarp. It works the same as Harp no arguments required.
