/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain how you implemented the nearest insertion heuristic.
 **********************************************************************/
   I found the distance between the new point and each point currently
   in the linked list and kept the smallest distance.
   
/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain how you implemented the smallest insertion heuristic.
 *  It's sufficient to list only the differences between this
 *  heuristic and the nearest insertion heuristic.
 **********************************************************************/
   I inserted the point into every spot in the linked list and calculated
   total distance each time. Added the point in the spot the resulted in
   the smallest distance.
