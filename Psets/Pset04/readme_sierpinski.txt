/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources

 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA lab hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA lab hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

   I got the idea from a meme I saw about Kirby eating burgers and decided
   to recreate an animation using recursive functions. It creates a spiral
   of Kirbies slowly eating burgers.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Is the following a use of recursion? yes/no 
 *  
 * public static void a() {
 *     b(5);
 *     b(2);
 *     b(7);
 *     b(4); 
 * }
 * public static void b(int a) {
 *     a();
 * }
 *
 *  Explain your reasoning in 20 WORDS OR LESS.
 **********************************************************************/
   Yes because although "a" isnt calling itself directly it is calling 
   itself indirectly through another function.
